# PlotClock
A repository for everything Plotclock-related.

PlotClock was a project I started during 2016. [PlotClock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOLFP90DneY) is a miniature, arduino-powered robot that plots the time. Although never fully completed, PlotClock was a catalyst to my future programming endeavors.

See the original PlotClock [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:248009).
